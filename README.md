## Branches
A branch will be made for every module that will be implemented. The reason for this is to allow the developer to implement, experiment and test any new functionality without damaging the original code base. The code implemented in the different branches will only be merged with the main branch once it has been tested thoroughly and it is considered as the finished product for that module. 

The current branches in mind are the following:
* Device Module
* Chat Module
* Calendar Module
* Alerts Module
* Voice Transcriber
*
